# Why I Started Cybersecurity

This is my first blog post! A start into documenting my progress into cybersecurity.

## Beginnings in IT
I have had an interest in computers very early into my life. When I was a kid around 8-10 years old, I have been experiencing usage of the family's PC for fulfilling my entertainment needs by playing games. A few years later I wanted to do more- I wanted to create a game, and so I have grabbed my first book in programming called "C How to Program".

## Advancing More Into IT

My interest in computers and programming rose quickly and I have decided to study computer science in universtiy, and so I did and recieved my bachelor's. I have done some web development courses since and some projects on the side. During my course studies, I have learned a bit of security techniques such as authentication, authorization, SSL, and JWTs. These techniques grabbed my eyes even more than anything I have worked with and from there I decided to read more into cybersecurity, which led me to apply *and thankfully accepted* into a master's programme for cybersecurity.

## My Path Into CyberSecurity

From that point, I have decided to reinforce my knowledge more in cybersecurity through following a learning path in TryHackMe. It is quite the powerful website teaching you cybersecurity concepts while also giving you some hands on practical experience through its machines.

I am also preparing for CompTIA Security+. It's a widely known and recognised certificate so it is a very worthwhile investment and will give a significant boost to my knowledge and credentials. I am currently taking a Udemy course to study for the exam.

It is also important to stay up-to-date with what's going around, so I am reading the latest cybersecurity new from TheCyberWire. They have a podcast so it's quite convenient to listen to it while I am doing a mundane task.

## Future Steps
For the future, I plan on building home labs to implement what I have learned and reinforce it. I also plan, once I am ready, to take on freelance jobs and bounty hunting tasks.

I plan on having an impressive portfolio, and eventually manage to land a job in the cybersecurity field where I will find a place to get my passion to work.
